What excites me about this position, and why work in SDET when I was a backend engineer?
    I combined the two questions from the test. I want a fresh view of engineering from another perspective. I want to experience the
automation side. I want to expand my skill sets. In my mind, no engineer should be pigeonholed into one position or industry.
