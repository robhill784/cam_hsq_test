1) What's the right role for QA in software development process?
    I am not sure what this question is asking. I think QA should be in any role from coder, designer, testers and management.
    
2) As a QA person, I have 2 weeks before the team writes code. What do I do?
   I would sit in any and all meetings that goes over specifications and requirements. I would take notes and collaborate
with other developers/designers to gather as much information as I can. I would use this information to compile test plans
and share it with the developers. I would then have a feedback/edit cycle to ensure everyone is on the same page about quality
expecations before coding starts.

3) Appropriate use for automated testing? Manual testing?
   For automated testing, from my experience at Nokia, is when we can
      simulate interaction between 2 components
      simulate interaction between a component and HWAPI
      simulate HW topology and HW topology changes
   Manual testing would be used for testing actual software/hardware interactions between radios and user devices. Anything that
cannot be simulated via software.
   
4) Dev team added new features and refactored code for old features. I am in charge of integration testing. What do I test?
   Since this is integration, I would test if the interactions between the relevant components still work.
      Was there an interface change of relevant components?
      Was there a change to the way relevant components interact via messages?
   I would just test the interaction between the changed component and the components it would interact with directly.
