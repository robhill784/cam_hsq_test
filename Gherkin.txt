New to this Gherkin way of defining tests. I am sure in a work environment I can get better at it.

1)
Feature: Cities in descending order
  Have a list of cities, want them in descending order

  Scenario: Input and/or Output filenames not passed in
    Given lack of filenames passed in
    When both files are expected
    Then exit with an error

  Scenario: Input and Output filenames passed in
    Given a list of cities in an input file
    When the input file is open  
        And the list of cities are not in order
    Then the list should be in descending alphebetical order in the output file

2)
The first scenario is pretty concrete. The program requirements state that for an input file, there should be an output file.
These arguments, i assume, need to be passed in (What file are we openening? Where should the output be stored?). With that
in mind, the test and that behavior should not change.

The second scenario, as well as the feature, could be made more generic. I did see in the requirements
that "your program should handle other content as well", so city names might not be the only thing passed in.

  Scenario: Input and Output filenames passed in
    Given a list of things in an input file
    When the input file is open  
        And the list of things is in some order
    Then the list should be in descending order in the output file
    
 In any case, the behaviour of the program outputting a list of things in descending order does not change, even if the program
 expands what it can list in descending order.
